# Pyramidal-Symbol-Structure
This includes an example of the Pyramidal symbol structure. This was written before the model evolved into a hierarchical symbol structure from an artificial neural network. Written in javascript it outputs to an HTML5 Canvas element. The example generates a network with a max node (symbol) cound between 50 and 5050.
